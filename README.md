## A Brief of the Prototype:
A neurological condition called dyslexia impairs a person's capacity for reading, writing, and spelling. It affects how the brain interprets language, making it challenging for those with dyslexia to understand written content. Between 5% and 20% of Indians suffer with dyslexia, with urban regions having a higher prevalence of the condition. This indicates that millions of Indian school children experience reading and comprehension problems as a result of this disorder. The creation of solutions like our product Dyslexify, a machine learning initiative intended to help people with dyslexia improve their reading and comprehension skills, has been made possible by technological developments using intelâ€™s oneAPI.

    * The oneAPI Rendering Toolkit is used to create 3D models, which are then hosted on a WebAR platform for easy accessibility. 
    * The models are converted into the glTF format and uploaded to the chosen platform. 
    * Users can view and interact with the models through web browsers on various devices, without the need for specialized applications or high-end hardware.
    This combination of powerful rendering tools powered by intel oneAPI 
    and WebAR technology provides a seamless experience for individuals to explore and engage with captivating in augmented reality.

## What I Learned:
The Dyslexify project aimed to address the challenges faced by individuals with dyslexia in reading, writing, and comprehension. By leveraging Intel's oneAPI technologies, including the Intel Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL), Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), and Intel Deep Learning (oneDNN), the project aimed to create a machine learning initiative to improve the lives of students in India and worldwide who struggle with dyslexia.
Through the Dyslexify project and the utilization of Intel's oneAPI technologies, we have learned the transformative impact that technology can have on the lives of individuals with dyslexia. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning capabilities, Dyslexify has the potential to revolutionize the way dyslexic students access, comprehend, and engage with written content. This project serves as a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration in making a positive difference in the lives of millions of dyslexic individuals in India and beyond.
